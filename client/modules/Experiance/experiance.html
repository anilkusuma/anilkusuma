                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWorking in one of the worlds top Product Development company does not give us much scope to learn the entire software development cycle and challenges involved in product release.</p>
                    <p>A project which started as a way to get experience on software development and product design, finally led to foundation of Pagon Technologies Pvt Ltd.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAt Pagon Technologies Pvt Ltd, we solve the problems faced by Logistics and Transport company owners.
                    We try to bring innovations in Transport Management System. I have created an online portal which acquires data from GPS based terminals installed in Vehicles through socket connections and perform various analytics on the received GPS information. Owners are presented with all the analytic reports of the vehicle along with Real-time accurate location of the vehicle and Past history of the route taken by vehicle.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAs most of the GPS terminals present in India are imported from China which does not last longer and does not provide warranty. With the help of my co-founder we at Pagon Technologies manufactured GPS Terminals here in Hyderabad at affordable price. We have device in multiple variants and offer tailor made devices and software based on the requirements of the client. </p>
                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis whole process has thought me many things, mainly <b>Requirement analysis,Product Design,Development Cycle,Modular Design,Team work,Customer centered mindset etc</b></p>
                    <p>"How best we design, we might miss the only small thing which customer wants."</p>
