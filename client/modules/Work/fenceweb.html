					<h4>Crown Solar Fence Controller</h4>
					<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<b>Crown Solar</b> is leading company in Solar Fence category and has many security related products in its catalog.Many government organizations like ISRO,BARC,DRDO etc are using Crown Solar Fence Systems.Crown has also installed its equipment in government buildings like Assembly,CM Office,High Courts in various states.</p>
					<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspTo provide better services to its clients, We have created web and android application that allows users to control the fence system from remote location replacing the need of manual controls. As the hardware is designed and manufactured by Crown Solar in India, they have made changes in system to transfer data through TCP Connection using GSM module.Through NodeJs sockets, application accepts data from all the devices,perform analytics on the data received and notifies user about system status in real time,thus helping the users monitor and control the system remotely.</p>
					<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe Connection and data transfer is done through secure TCP Connection, Connection is established after authentication by unique key installed in device during manufacturing. Data is encrypted before transfer and encryption key is different for each device.</p>
					<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspApplication flow is, Admin creates a site(which is a building or place covered with fence), each site is installed with multiple devices around the perimeter, device contains a unique IEMI number to communicate. Each site is assigned to a user(Security in-charge of the site). A login is created to that user, with the login details, user can monitor or control the devices in his site.</p>
